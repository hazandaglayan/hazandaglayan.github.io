Hello! I am Hazan and I have been a PhD student at Mathematical Enginnering department under the supervision of [Pierre-Antoine Absil](https://sites.uclouvain.be/absil/) and [Nicolas Gillis](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasgillis/publications?authuser=0) at UCLouvain (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) since 2020.

I work on low rank approximations and image processing techniques for exoplanet detections. Previously, I worked randomized numerical linear algebra in my PhD studies. 

Before my PhD, I worked in a supercomputer center in Germany and I was classifying manuscripts as syllogism and text using convolutional neural network. At the same time I was working as high performance computing administrator in the same research center.

In my master thesis, I worked on shadow detection in multispectral an hyperspectral images for remote sensing images. 

I like dancing especially traditional dances like halay :-), I like cycling, hiking and meeting with my friends. I also like visiting new cities but during my PhD and corona days, I couldn't find time. I expect to visit again after PhD :-).
