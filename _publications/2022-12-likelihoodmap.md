Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task due to the small angular distance and high contrast relative to their host star, and the presence of quasi-static noise. We propose a new statistical method for direct imaging of exoplanets based on a likelihood ratio detection map, which assumes that the noise after the background subtraction step obeys a Laplacian distribution. We compare the method with two detection approaches based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) map after performing the background subtraction by the widely used Annular Principal Component Analysis (AnnPCA). The experimental results on the Beta Pictoris data set show the method outperforms SNR maps in terms of achieving the highest true positive rate (TPR) at zero false positive rate (FPR).
